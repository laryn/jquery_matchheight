# jQuery matchHeight

## In process (non-functional)

Backdrop module based on the Drupal equalheights.module.

This module implements a jQuery plugin that can equalize the height of the
user specified elements with the same class.
By default, the height of the tallest element is used, but minimum and
maximum height can also be set.
